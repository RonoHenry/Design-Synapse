## Next Steps for Implementation

### **CRITICAL: TDD Remediation Required**

**⚠️ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Fix TDD Violations**

The implementation violates TDD principles by having code without corresponding unit tests. This creates technical debt and reduces code quality.

### **Phase 5 Critical Priority Order:**
1. **Task 8.1:** Write missing unit tests for VisualGenerationService (CRITICAL)
2. **Task 8.2:** Write missing unit tests for Celery tasks (CRITICAL)
3. **Task 8.3:** Fix existing integration test failures (HIGH)
4. **Task 9.1:** Write comprehensive integration tests (MEDIUM)
5. **Task 9.2:** Verify backward compatibility (LOW)

### **TDD Remediation Approach:**
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all untested code
- Mock all external dependencies properly
- Achieve 100% test coverage for new functionality
- Fix configuration issues causing test failures
- Ensure all tests pass consistently before proceeding

### **Key Implementation Principles:**
1. **Backward Compatibility:** All changes must be non-breaking
2. **Error Handling:** Visual generation failures don't break design creation
3. **Cost Control:** Implement budget limits and monitoring
4. **Performance:** Use async tasks for long-running operations
5. **Testing:** Comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality

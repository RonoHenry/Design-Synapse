# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical technical debt issues across the DesignSynapse microservices architecture that must be resolved before implementing new features. The system currently has database model inconsistencies, import structure problems, configuration issues, missing test infrastructure, and outdated dependency patterns that impact reliability, maintainability, and development velocity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Model Consistency and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent and properly validated database models across all services, so that data integrity is maintained and development is predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Citation model is created THEN the system SHALL enforce proper foreign key relationships with cascade delete behavior
2. WHEN model validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use consistent validation patterns across all services
3. WHEN database relationships are defined THEN the system SHALL use proper SQLAlchemy 2.0 relationship patterns
4. WHEN model constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. IF a resource is deleted THEN the system SHALL automatically cascade delete related citations and bookmarks
6. WHEN models are instantiated THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and data types consistently

### Requirement 2: Import Structure Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent import structures across services, so that code is maintainable and circular import issues are eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing models THEN the system SHALL use consistent relative import patterns within each service
2. WHEN cross-service references are needed THEN the system SHALL use proper service boundaries without direct model imports
3. WHEN circular imports occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them through proper module organization
4. WHEN __init__.py files are used THEN the system SHALL properly expose public APIs without creating import cycles
5. IF import errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the resolution path

### Requirement 3: Configuration Management Modernization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modern, consistent configuration management across services, so that deployment and environment management is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Pinecone configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL use environment variables with proper validation
2. WHEN LLM providers are configured THEN the system SHALL support multiple providers with fallback mechanisms
3. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL use consistent connection patterns across services
4. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested fixes
5. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults where appropriate or fail fast with clear messages

### Requirement 4: Test Infrastructure Establishment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test infrastructure, so that code changes can be validated reliably and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL provide isolated test databases for each service
2. WHEN test fixtures are needed THEN the system SHALL provide reusable factory patterns for model creation
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL properly mock external service dependencies
4. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 80% coverage for critical paths
5. IF test setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for environment issues

### Requirement 5: Dependency Modernization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modern dependency patterns and versions, so that the codebase benefits from latest features, security updates, and performance improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQLAlchemy is used THEN the system SHALL use SQLAlchemy 2.0+ patterns with proper type hints
2. WHEN Pydantic models are defined THEN the system SHALL use Pydantic v2 patterns with proper validation
3. WHEN FastAPI is used THEN the system SHALL use compatible versions with proper async patterns
4. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing APIs
5. IF dependency conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them with minimal breaking changes

### Requirement 6: Service Boundary Enforcement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear service boundaries, so that services remain loosely coupled and can be developed independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL use HTTP APIs rather than direct database access
2. WHEN data is shared between services THEN the system SHALL use proper DTOs/schemas for data transfer
3. WHEN service dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL be clearly documented and minimized
4. WHEN service interfaces change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility or provide migration paths
5. IF service coupling increases THEN the system SHALL provide refactoring guidance to maintain separation

### Requirement 7: Error Handling Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling patterns, so that debugging is efficient and user experience is predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error response formats
2. WHEN validation errors happen THEN the system SHALL return structured error messages with field-level details
3. WHEN external service calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry and fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL include sufficient context for debugging
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL alert monitoring systems appropriately

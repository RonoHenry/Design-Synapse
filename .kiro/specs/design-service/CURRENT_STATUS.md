## ‚úÖ What We've Built (Working & Tested)

### 1. AI Design Generation
- User describes building in plain English
- GPT-4 generates complete design specification
- Includes: structure, materials, spaces, compliance
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & TESTED

### 2. Building Code Validation
- Validates designs against Kenya Building Code
- Identifies violations and warnings
- Compliance scoring
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & TESTED

### 3. AI Optimization
- Cost optimization suggestions
- Structural improvements
- Sustainability enhancements
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & TESTED

### 4. Version Control
- Track design iterations
- Parent-child relationships
- Full version history
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & TESTED

### 5. Collaboration
- Comments on designs
- Spatial annotations
- Team collaboration
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & TESTED

### 6. File Management
- Upload CAD files (DWG, DXF, IFC, PDF)
- Download files
- 50MB size limit
- **Status:** üîÑ TESTS COMPLETE, IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS

---

## üîÑ Current Task

**Task 24.2:** Implement file upload/download/delete endpoints
- **Tests:** ‚úÖ Written (27 test cases)
- **Implementation:** ‚è≥ Next (2-3 days)
- **Blocker:** None

## ‚ùå What's Missing (Original Vision)

### Visual Outputs
1. **2D Floor Plans** - AI-generated architectural drawings
2. **3D Renderings** - Photorealistic visualizations
3. **3D Models** - STEP/IFC files for CAD tools
4. **Drone Integration** - Site surveys and AR overlays

**Why Missing:** Requirements document didn't include these features initially.

**Solution:** Add as Phase 2 enhancement (non-breaking).

## üìÖ Timeline

### This Week (Phase 1 Completion)
- **Day 1-2:** Implement file endpoints (task 24.2)
- **Day 3:** Integration testing
- **Day 4-5:** Deploy to staging

### Next 4 Weeks (Phase 2 - Visual Outputs)
- **Week 1:** AI floor plan generation
- **Week 2:** AI rendering generation
- **Week 3:** Basic 3D model generation
- **Week 4:** Testing & deployment

### Future (Phase 3 - Drone Integration)
- **8-12 weeks:** Site survey processing, AR visualization

## üí∞ Cost Estimates

### Current System (Per Design)
- GPT-4 API: $0.10 - $0.30
- Storage: $0.01
- **Total:** ~$0.15 per design

### With Visual Outputs (Per Design)
- GPT-4 API: $0.10 - $0.30
- DALL-E 3 (floor plan): $0.04
- Stable Diffusion (rendering): $0.02
- Storage: $0.05
- **Total:** ~$0.25 per design

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Phase 1 (This Week)
- [ ] All 27 file tests passing
- [ ] File upload/download working
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] No breaking changes

### Phase 2 (Next Month)
- [ ] Designs include AI-generated floor plans
- [ ] Designs include photorealistic renderings
- [ ] 3D models can be generated
- [ ] Visual generation < 60 seconds
- [ ] All existing features still work

## üöÄ Next Actions

1. **You:** Review and approve this plan
2. **Me:** Implement task 24.2 (file endpoints)
3. **Us:** Test Phase 1 completion
4. **Me:** Create Phase 2 spec (visual outputs)
5. **You:** Review Phase 2 spec
6. **Us:** Begin Phase 2 implementation

## üìû Questions for Chief Architect

1. **Timeline:** Is 5 weeks to visual outputs acceptable?
2. **Scope:** Should we include all 3 visual types (floor plans, renderings, 3D models)?
3. **Quality:** Preference for AI provider (DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney)?
4. **Budget:** Is $0.25 per design with visuals within budget?
5. **Drone:** When should we start Phase 3 (drone integration)?

---

**Status:** Awaiting approval to proceed with Phase 2 spec creation.

# Design Service Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Design Service is the core AI-powered feature of DesignSynapse that revolutionizes the DAEC (Design, Architecture, Engineering, Construction) industry by providing intelligent design generation, validation, and optimization capabilities. This service leverages advanced AI/ML models to assist architects, engineers, and construction professionals in creating building designs that are optimized for African construction standards, sustainable practices, and local building codes.

The service integrates with the existing project management system, allowing users to generate, store, version, and iterate on architectural designs within their projects. It provides AI-assisted design generation from natural language descriptions, validates designs against building codes and standards, and offers optimization suggestions for structural integrity, cost efficiency, and sustainability.

4. IF a design has warnings but no critical violations THEN the system Slianrnings"
5. WHEN validation is peem SHALLe withiard residential designs
6. WHEN validation rules are updated THEN the system SHALL allow re-validation of existing designs

### Requirement 4: AI-Powered Design Optimization

**User Story:** As a cost estimator, I want to receive AI-generated optimization suggestions for designs, so that I can reduce construction costs while maintaining quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a design is submitted for optimization THEN the system SHALL analyze it for cost, structural, and sustainability improvements
2. WHEN optimization suggestions are generated THEN the system SHALL provide at least 3 actionable recommendations
3. WHEN an optimization is suggested THEN the system SHALL include estimated cost impact and implementation difficulty
4. IF no optimizations are found THEN the system SHALL return a message indicating the design is already optimized
5. WHEN a user applies an optimization suggestion THEN the system SHALL create a new design version with the changes
6. WHEN optimization analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL complete within 20 seconds

### Requirement 5: Design Metadata and Search

**User Story:** As an architect, I want to search and filter designs by various criteria, so that I can quickly find relevant designs across multiple projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a design is created THEN the system SHALL extract and store metadata (building type, area, floors, materials)
2. WHEN a user searches designs by building type THEN the system SHALL return all matching designs
3. WHEN a user filters designs by date range THEN the system SHALL return designs created within that range
4. WHEN a user searches by project THEN the system SHALL return all designs associated with that project
5. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL include design thumbnails and key metadata
6. WHEN a user has no access to a project THEN the system SHALL exclude those designs from search results

### Requirement 6: Design File Management

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to attach supporting files (CAD drawings, images, PDFs) to designs, so that I can keep all design-related documents organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file to a design THEN the system SHALL accept files up to 50MB in size
2. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL support common formats (PDF, DWG, DXF, PNG, JPG, IFC)
3. WHEN a file is stored THEN the system SHALL generate a secure download URL valid for 1 hour
4. WHEN a design has attached files THEN the system SHALL list all files with names, sizes, and upload dates
5. IF a file upload fails THEN the system SHALL return a specific error (file too large, unsupported format, storage error)
6. WHEN a design version is created THEN the system SHALL copy file references to the new version

### Requirement 7: Design Collaboration and Comments

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to add comments and annotations to designs, so that I can collaborate with colleagues on design improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a comment to a design THEN the system SHALL store it with timestamp and author information
2. WHEN a comment is added THEN the system SHALL allow optional coordinate-based positioning for spatial annotations
3. WHEN a user views a design THEN the system SHALL display all comments in chronological order
4. WHEN a user edits their own comment THEN the system SHALL update it and mark it as edited
5. WHEN a user deletes their own comment THEN the system SHALL remove it from the design
6. IF a user is not a project member THEN the system SHALL prevent them from commenting on project designs

### Requirement 8: Design Export and Integration

**User Story:** As a construction manager, I want to export designs in standard formats, so that I can use them with external tools and contractors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests design export THEN the system SHALL support JSON, PDF, and IFC formats
2. WHEN exporting to JSON THEN the system SHALL include all design data, metadata, and validation results
3. WHEN exporting to PDF THEN the system SHALL generate a formatted document with design specifications and diagrams
4. WHEN exporting to IFC THEN the system SHALL create a valid Building Information Model file

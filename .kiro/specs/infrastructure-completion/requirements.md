# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical infrastructure gaps that must be resolved to make DesignSynapse production-ready. The system currently lacks centralized API routing, cross-service authentication, monitoring capabilities, and production-grade configuration management. These infrastructure components are essential for scalability, security, observability, and operational reliability in a production environment.

## Glossary

- **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point that routes requests to appropriate microservices
- **Service Registry**: Component that maintains a registry of available services and their endpoints
- **Cross-Service Authentication**: Authentication mechanism that validates requests between internal services
- **Observability**: The ability to understand system behavior through logging, metrics, and tracing
- **Health Check Aggregation**: Centralized monitoring of service health status across all microservices
- **Rate Limiting**: Mechanism to control the number of requests a client can make within a time window
- **Circuit Breaker**: Pattern that prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Gateway and Service Discovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a centralized API gateway with service discovery, so that all external requests are properly routed and internal services can communicate efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an external request is made THEN the API Gateway SHALL route the request to the appropriate microservice based on URL patterns
2. WHEN a service starts up THEN the Service Registry SHALL automatically register the service with its health check endpoint
3. WHEN a service becomes unavailable THEN the Service Registry SHALL remove it from the available services list within 30 seconds
4. WHEN load balancing is needed THEN the API Gateway SHALL distribute requests across multiple instances of the same service
5. IF a service is not available THEN the API Gateway SHALL return a 503 Service Unavailable response with appropriate error details
6. WHEN service discovery occurs THEN the System SHALL maintain an up-to-date registry of all active service endpoints

### Requirement 2: Cross-Service Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want standardized authentication across all services, so that only authorized requests can access protected resources and service-to-service communication is secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request contains a JWT token THEN all services SHALL validate the token using the same authentication middleware
2. WHEN services communicate internally THEN the System SHALL use service-to-service authentication tokens
3. WHEN a token expires THEN the System SHALL reject the request with a 401 Unauthorized response
4. WHEN role-based access is required THEN the System SHALL enforce permissions based on user roles and service endpoints
5. IF authentication fails THEN the System SHALL log the failure with sufficient context for security monitoring
6. WHEN authentication middleware is applied THEN the System SHALL add user context to request headers for downstream services

### Requirement 3: Monitoring and Observability Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability, so that I can detect issues quickly, understand system performance, and troubleshoot problems effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services generate logs THEN the System SHALL collect and centralize all logs with structured formatting
2. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the System SHALL track response times, error rates, and resource utilization for all services
3. WHEN health checks run THEN the System SHALL aggregate health status from all services and provide a unified health endpoint
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the System SHALL capture distributed traces to show request flow across services
5. IF system performance degrades THEN the System SHALL trigger alerts based on configurable thresholds
6. WHEN monitoring data is queried THEN the System SHALL provide dashboards for real-time system visibility

### Requirement 4: Production Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want secure and environment-specific configuration management, so that services can be deployed safely across different environments with proper security controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services start THEN the System SHALL load configuration from environment-specific sources with validation
2. WHEN secrets are needed THEN the System SHALL retrieve them from secure storage without exposing them in logs
3. WHEN SSL/TLS is required THEN the System SHALL enforce encrypted connections for all external communications
4. WHEN rate limiting is configured THEN the System SHALL enforce request limits per client and endpoint
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the System SHALL fail fast with clear error messages during startup
6. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the System SHALL use secure defaults or fail with specific guidance

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want standardized error handling and resilience patterns, so that the system gracefully handles failures and provides consistent error responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external service calls fail THEN the System SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures
2. WHEN temporary failures occur THEN the System SHALL retry requests with exponential backoff and jitter
3. WHEN errors are returned THEN the System SHALL provide consistent error response formats across all services
4. WHEN services are overloaded THEN the System SHALL implement graceful degradation strategies
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the System SHALL alert monitoring systems and log detailed error context
6. WHEN timeout limits are reached THEN the System SHALL cancel requests and return appropriate timeout responses

### Requirement 6: Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive security controls, so that the system is protected against common attacks and security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP requests are received THEN the System SHALL enforce security headers including CORS, CSP, and HSTS
2. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN the System SHALL prevent abuse by limiting requests per IP and user
3. WHEN input validation occurs THEN the System SHALL sanitize and validate all input data to prevent injection attacks
4. WHEN sensitive data is logged THEN the System SHALL mask or exclude sensitive information from logs
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the System SHALL implement automated blocking and alerting mechanisms
6. WHEN API endpoints are exposed THEN the System SHALL require authentication for all non-public endpoints

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization and Caching

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want optimized response times and efficient resource usage, so that the system can handle production load with acceptable performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frequently accessed data is requested THEN the System SHALL implement caching strategies to reduce database load
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the System SHALL use connection pooling and query optimization
3. WHEN static assets are served THEN the System SHALL implement CDN integration and proper caching headers
4. WHEN concurrent requests occur THEN the System SHALL handle them efficiently without resource exhaustion
5. IF performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the System SHALL trigger scaling mechanisms or alerts
6. WHEN caching is used THEN the System SHALL implement cache invalidation strategies to maintain data consistency

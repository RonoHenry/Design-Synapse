# Design Service Test Infrastructure Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the test infrastructure created for the Design Service. The infrastructure follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and provides a solid foundation for implementing and testing all design service features.

## Components Created

### 1. Test Configuration (`tests/conftest.py`)

The conftest.py file provides comprehensive test fixtures for the design service:

#### Database Fixtures
- `db_engine`: Creates a test database engine (SQLite in-memory by default, TiDB for integration tests)
- `db_session`: Provides an isolated database session for each test with automatic cleanup
- `clean_db`: Ensures clean database state for each test
- `performance_db_session`: Specialized session for performance testing

#### Mock Service Fixtures
- `mock_llm_client`: Mock OpenAI/LLM client for design generation and optimization
  - `generate_design_specification()`: Returns mock design specification with confidence score
  - `generate_optimizations()`: Returns mock optimization suggestions (cost, structural, sustainability)

- `mock_project_client`: Mock project service client
  - `verify_project_access()`: Async method to verify user has project access
  - `get_project_details()`: Async method to retrieve project information

- `mock_user_client`: Mock user service client
  - `get_user_details()`: Async method to retrieve user information
  - `verify_user()`: Async method to verify user validity

- `mock_external_services`: Combined fixture providing all mock services

#### Test Data Fixtures
- `test_user_id`: Provides a test user ID (default: 1)
- `test_project_id`: Provides a test project ID (default: 1)
- `auth_headers`: Provides authorization headers for API testing

#### API Testing Fixtures
- `client`: FastAPI test client with database session override

### 2. Test Factories (`tests/factories.py`)

Factory classes for creating test data using factory_boy:

#### Core Factories

**DesignFactory**
- Creates Design model instances with realistic data
- Includes specification JSON with building info, structure, spaces, materials
- Supports traits: `residential`, `commercial`, `industrial`, `validated`, `compliant`, `archived`
- Default values: residential building, 250.5 sqm, 2 floors, 85.5% confidence score

**DesignValidationFactory**
- Creates DesignValidation instances linked to designs
- Supports traits: `compliant`, `with_violations`, `with_warnings`
- Default: compliant validation with Kenya Building Code 2020

**DesignOptimizationFactory**
- Creates DesignOptimization instances with suggestions
- Supports traits: `cost`, `structural`, `sustainability`, `applied`, `rejected`
- Default: cost optimization with -15% impact, medium difficulty

**DesignFileFactory**
- Creates DesignFile instances for attached files
- Supports traits: `pdf`, `dwg`, `image`, `large`
- Default: 1MB PDF file

**DesignCommentFactory**
- Creates DesignComment instances for collaboration
- Supports traits: `with_position`, `edited`
- Default: text comment without spatial positioning

#### Helper Functions

- `create_design_with_validations(session, num_validations=2, **kwargs)`: Create design with validations
- `create_design_with_optimizations(session, num_optimizations=3, **kwargs)`: Create design with optimizations
- `create_design_with_files(session, num_files=3, **kwargs)`: Create design with attached files
- `create_design_with_comments(session, num_comments=5, **kwargs)`: Create design with comments
- `create_complete_design(session, **kwargs)`: Create design with all relationships populated
- `create_design_version_chain(session, num_versions=3, **kwargs)`: Create version history chain

### 3. Test Infrastructure Verification (`tests/test_infrastructure.py`)

Comprehensive test suite (33 tests) verifying:

#### Fixture Tests
- Database engine and session creation
- Mock service configuration and behavior
- Test data fixtures (user ID, project ID, auth headers)
- Session isolation between tests
- Multiple fixtures working together

#### Factory Tests
- Factory importability
- Factory structure and Meta configuration
- Helper function availability
- Factory configuration with sessions

#### Mock Service Tests
- LLM client mock returns valid specifications and optimizations
- Project client mock returns valid project data
- User client mock returns valid user data
- Async mock methods work correctly

#### Integration Tests
- Common testing infrastructure availability
- Conftest imports successfully
- All components work together

## Usage Examples

### Using Database Fixtures

```python
def test_create_design(db_session):
    """Test creating a design."""
    design = Design(
        name="Test Design",
        project_id=1,
        specification={"building_info": {}},
        created_by=1
    )
    db_session.add(design)
    db_session.commit()
    
    assert design.id is not None
```

### Using Factories

```python
def test_design_with_validations(db_session):
    """Test design with validations."""
    from tests.factories import create_design_with_validations
    
    design = create_design_with_validations(
        db_session,
        num_validations=2,
        name="Validated Design"
    )
    
    assert len(design.validations) == 2
```

### Using Mock Services

```python
def test_design_generation(mock_llm_client):
    """Test design generation with mock LLM."""
    result = mock_llm_client.generate_design_specification()
    
    assert result["confidence_score"] == 85.5
    assert "specification" in result
```

### Using API Client

```python
def test_create_design_endpoint(client, auth_headers):
    """Test design creation endpoint."""
    response = client.post(
        "/api/v1/designs",
        json={"name": "Test", "project_id": 1},
        headers=auth_headers
    )
    
    assert response.status_code == 201
```

## Test Execution

### Run All Infrastructure Tests
```bash
pytest apps/design-service/tests/test_infrastructure.py -v
```

### Run Specific Test
```bash
pytest apps/design-service/tests/test_infrastructure.py::test_db_session_fixture -v
```

### Run with Coverage
```bash
pytest apps/design-service/tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

## Environment Configuration

### Default (Unit Tests)
- Uses SQLite in-memory database
- Fast, isolated tests
- No external dependencies

### Integration Tests
Set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable:
```bash
export TEST_DATABASE_URL="mysql+pymysql://user:pass@host:port/test_db?charset=utf8mb4"
pytest apps/design-service/tests/
```

## Next Steps

Once the models are created in Phase 2, update the factories:

1. Import the actual model classes
2. Set `Meta.model` to the actual model class
3. Adjust field definitions to match model fields
4. Run tests to verify factories work with real models

Example:
```python
from src.models.design import Design

class DesignFactory(BaseFactory, TimestampMixin):
    class Meta:
        model = Design  # Set to actual model
        sqlalchemy_session_persistence = "commit"
    
    # Fields remain the same
```

## Test Coverage Goals

- Unit tests: 90%+ coverage
- Integration tests: 80%+ coverage
- Critical paths: 100% coverage (design generation, validation)

## Verification Results

✅ All 33 infrastructure tests passing
✅ Database fixtures working correctly
✅ Mock services configured properly
✅ Factories structured correctly
✅ Helper functions available
✅ Async fixtures working
✅ Session isolation verified
✅ Common testing infrastructure integrated

## Requirements Satisfied

This test infrastructure satisfies requirements:
- **10.1**: Comprehensive test fixtures and factories
- **10.2**: Database session management with proper isolation
- **10.5**: Health check and service infrastructure support

The infrastructure is ready for Phase 2 (Core Data Models) implementation.

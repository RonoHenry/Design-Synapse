# Authentication and Authorization Fix Summary

## Task 33: Fix authentication and authorization issues

### Issues Fixed

1. **Test fixture usage for authentication tests**
   - Fixed `test_update_comment_without_auth` to use `client_no_auth` instead of `client`
   - Fixed `test_delete_comment_without_auth` to use `client_no_auth` instead of `client`
   - These tests were incorrectly using the authenticated client fixture, which was overriding authentication

2. **Project access denial testing**
   - Created new fixture `mock_project_client_access_denied` that returns a mock client with access denied
   - Created new fixture `client_no_project_access` that provides an authenticated client but with project access denied
   - Updated `test_create_comment_without_project_access` to use the new `client_no_project_access` fixture
   - This properly tests the 403 Forbidden response when a user doesn't have project access

### Changes Made

#### `apps/design-service/tests/conftest.py`

1. Added `mock_project_client_access_denied` fixture:
   - Returns a mock ProjectClient that raises `ProjectAccessDeniedError` when `verify_project_access` is called
   - Used for testing authorization failures

2. Added `client_no_project_access` fixture:
   - Provides a test client with authentication enabled but project access denied
   - Overrides all project client dependencies with the access-denied mock
   - Used for testing 403 Forbidden responses

#### `apps/design-service/tests/integration/api/v1/test_comments.py`

1. Updated `test_update_comment_without_auth`:
   - Changed from `client` to `client_no_auth` fixture
   - Now properly tests 401 Unauthorized response

2. Updated `test_delete_comment_without_auth`:
   - Changed from `client` to `client_no_auth` fixture
   - Now properly tests 401 Unauthorized response

3. Updated `test_create_comment_without_project_access`:
   - Changed from `client` with `mock_project_access_denied` to `client_no_project_access` fixture
   - Removed unused fixtures (`mock_auth_user`, `mock_project_access_denied`)
   - Now properly tests 403 Forbidden response

### Verification

All authentication and authorization tests now pass:

```bash
python -m pytest apps/design-service/tests/integration/api/v1/test_comments.py -v
```

**Results:**
- 20 tests passed
- 0 tests failed
- All authentication (401) and authorization (403) tests working correctly

### Route Configuration Verification

All comment endpoints properly require authentication via the `CurrentUserId` dependency:

- `POST /api/v1/designs/{design_id}/comments` - ✅ Requires auth
- `GET /api/v1/designs/{design_id}/comments` - ✅ Requires auth
- `PUT /api/v1/comments/{comment_id}` - ✅ Requires auth
- `DELETE /api/v1/comments/{comment_id}` - ✅ Requires auth

All endpoints also verify project access via `verify_design_access` helper function:

- Checks if design exists (404 if not found)
- Verifies user has project membership (403 if access denied)

### Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 2.4**: Project membership verification is enforced
- **Requirement 7.6**: Project membership required for commenting is properly implemented and tested

### Test Coverage

Authentication and authorization tests cover:

1. **401 Unauthorized responses**:
   - Creating comments without authentication
   - Listing comments without authentication
   - Updating comments without authentication
   - Deleting comments without authentication

2. **403 Forbidden responses**:
   - Creating comments without project access
   - Updating other users' comments
   - Deleting other users' comments

3. **Successful operations**:
   - All operations work correctly with proper authentication and authorization

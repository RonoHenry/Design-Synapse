# Service Communication Infrastructure - Implementation Summary

## Task 8.3 - Complete ✅

Successfully implemented comprehensive HTTP client infrastructure for inter-service communication following TDD principles and best practices.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Base HTTP Client (`base_client.py`)
- ✅ Async HTTP client with httpx
- ✅ Automatic retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s...)
- ✅ Circuit breaker pattern (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN states)
- ✅ Configurable timeouts
- ✅ Request/response logging
- ✅ Proper error handling for transient vs permanent failures

### 2. Service Registry (`service_registry.py`)
- ✅ Centralized service configuration management
- ✅ Environment variable-based configuration
- ✅ Service discovery by name
- ✅ Health check URL generation
- ✅ Support for all services (User, Project, Knowledge, Design, Analytics, Marketplace)

### 3. Typed Service Clients (`clients.py`)
- ✅ **UserServiceClient**: User management, authentication, roles
- ✅ **ProjectServiceClient**: Projects, comments, CRUD operations
- ✅ **KnowledgeServiceClient**: Resources, search, citations, recommendations
- ✅ Type-safe methods with proper signatures
- ✅ Domain-specific operations

### 4. Comprehensive Tests
- ✅ `test_base_client.py`: 8 tests covering retry, circuit breaker, backoff, logging
- ✅ `test_service_registry.py`: 8 tests covering configuration, registration, discovery
- ✅ `test_clients.py`: 9 tests covering all typed client methods
- ✅ All tests use mocks and AsyncMock for proper async testing

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive README with examples
- ✅ Usage patterns for all clients
- ✅ Configuration guide
- ✅ Best practices
- ✅ Error handling examples

## Key Features

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```python
# Prevents cascade failures
- CLOSED: Normal operation
- OPEN: After 5 failures, reject requests immediately  
- HALF_OPEN: After 60s, test if service recovered
```

### Retry Logic
```python
# Exponential backoff for transient failures
- Retry on: Timeout, connection errors
- No retry on: HTTP 4xx/5xx (fail fast)
- Backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s
```

### Request Logging
```
INFO: Request: GET http://service:8000/api/endpoint (attempt 1/3)
INFO: Response: GET http://service:8000/api/endpoint - 200
WARNING: Transient error on attempt 1: Timeout
INFO: Retrying in 1s...
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from common.http import UserServiceClient

client = UserServiceClient()
user = await client.get_user(user_id=1)
await client.close()
```

### With Configuration
```python
from common.http import BaseHTTPClient

client = BaseHTTPClient(
    base_url="http://service:8000",
    timeout=30.0,
    max_retries=3,
    circuit_breaker_threshold=5
)
```

### Service Registry
```python
from common.http import ServiceRegistry

registry = ServiceRegistry()
url = registry.get_base_url("user-service")
# http://localhost:8001/api/v1
```

## Environment Configuration

```bash
# User Service
USER_SERVICE_HOST=localhost
USER_SERVICE_PORT=8001
USER_SERVICE_PROTOCOL=http

# Project Service  
PROJECT_SERVICE_HOST=localhost
PROJECT_SERVICE_PORT=8003

# Knowledge Service
KNOWLEDGE_SERVICE_HOST=localhost
KNOWLEDGE_SERVICE_PORT=8002
```

## TDD Approach

1. ✅ **Tests First**: Created comprehensive test suite before implementation
2. ✅ **Red-Green-Refactor**: Tests defined expected behavior
3. ✅ **Mocking**: Used AsyncMock for async operations
4. ✅ **Coverage**: All major code paths tested
5. ✅ **Best Practices**: Followed pytest conventions

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **6.1**: Base HTTP client with error handling and timeout configuration
- ✅ **6.2**: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- ✅ **6.4**: Circuit breaker pattern for cascade failure prevention
- ✅ **6.1**: Service registry for endpoint discovery
- ✅ **6.2**: Request/response logging and tracing
- ✅ **6.4**: Typed client classes for each service

## Next Steps

The service communication infrastructure is now ready for use. Services can:

1. Import typed clients for inter-service communication
2. Configure service endpoints via environment variables
3. Benefit from automatic retry and circuit breaker protection
4. Debug with comprehensive request/response logging

## Integration Example

```python
# In project-service, calling user-service
from common.http import UserServiceClient

async def verify_project_owner(project_id: int, user_id: int):
    """Verify user owns the project."""
    user_client = UserServiceClient()
    
    try:
        # Get user from user-service
        user = await user_client.get_user(user_id)
        
        # Verify ownership
        if user["id"] == project_id.owner_id:
            return True
        return False
        
    finally:
        await user_client.close()
```

## Production Readiness

- ✅ Error handling for all failure scenarios
- ✅ Logging for debugging and monitoring
- ✅ Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures
- ✅ Retry logic handles transient failures
- ✅ Configurable timeouts prevent hanging requests
- ✅ Type safety with typed clients
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Documentation for all features

## Conclusion

Task 8.3 is complete with a production-ready service communication infrastructure that follows best practices, includes comprehensive tests, and provides a solid foundation for inter-service communication in the DesignSynapse platform.
